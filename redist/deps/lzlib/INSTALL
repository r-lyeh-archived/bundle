Requirements
------------
You will need a C compiler.
I use gcc 4.8.1 and 3.3.6, but the code should compile with any
standards compliant compiler.
Gcc is available at http://gcc.gnu.org.


Procedure
---------
1. Unpack the archive if you have not done so already:

	tar -xf lzlib[version].tar.lz
or
	lzip -cd lzlib[version].tar.lz | tar -xf -

This creates the directory ./lzlib[version] containing the source from
the main archive.

2. Change to lzlib directory and run configure.
   (Try 'configure --help' for usage instructions).

	cd lzlib[version]
	./configure

3. Run make.

	make

4. Optionally, type 'make check' to run the tests that come with lzlib.

5. Type 'make install' to install the library and any data files and
   documentation. (You might have to run ldconfig also).

   You can install only the library, the info manual or the man page
   typing 'make install-bin', 'make install-info' or 'make install-man'
   respectively.

   Instead of 'make install', you can type 'make install-as-lzip' to
   install the library and any data files and documentation, and link
   minilzip to the name 'lzip'.


Another way
-----------
You can also compile lzlib into a separate directory. To do this, you
must use a version of 'make' that supports the 'VPATH' variable, such
as GNU 'make'. 'cd' to the directory where you want the object files
and executables to go and run the 'configure' script. 'configure'
automatically checks for the source code in '.', in '..' and in the
directory that 'configure' is in.

'configure' recognizes the option '--srcdir=DIR' to control where to
look for the sources. Usually 'configure' can determine that directory
automatically.

After running 'configure', you can run 'make' and 'make install' as
explained above.
